### All made by Xanonymous.
We have received a notification requesting to "close the HomeWork code project" on github. 
In response, we have taken or "may" have taken the following actions: 
1. The git remote setting of github has been removed from this project. 
2. The github repository url may have been changed or its permissions set to private.
After these operations, you will not be able to obtain our github project,
and of course you will not be able to see the original code.
What is you can see is it just like the same as everything is never happened.
Best regards, Xanonymous.
